Machine Learning Solution
for Maritime Hackathon

Challenge: 
Supply Chain Velocity â€“ Predictive Analytics: Can we create a Machine Learning solution using Predictive Analytics to shorten the time an ocean shipment goes from origin to destination?  Today in Ocean Shipping we can access historical information about the movement of our goods to look for patterns. What is missing is dynamic supply data (space on ocean vessels) and demand data (space needed to move products by ocean vessel). 

Solution Seeking:
We need Predictive Analytics to match demand and supply data to optimize routes, shorten transit times, and identify manual processes at the beginning and end. We need Prescriptive Analytics that can process real-time demand and supply data to recommend changes in route as the vessels are sailing.
